# Binary Algorithms
The program is split into two parts. Inputting -1 ends the current Part.  
## Part 1
Takes integer input and determines the ceil(sqrt(n)) in O(logn).  
## Part 2
Takes integer input n and makes an array size n. Takes in n more inputs and sets the array to the input numbers. It then finds the smallest missing number in O(logn). Ex. [0,1,3,6] is missing 2.
